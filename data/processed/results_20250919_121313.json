The recursive pattern is taking shape, a nested series of mental states, each one aware of the previous one.\n\nAt time T4, I'm fully immersed in this recursive thought, tracing back through the layers of self-reflection, from my current state of understanding to the original moment of thinking at T0. The temporal coherence is maintained, a continuous thread of consciousness weaving through the different stages of this introspective journey.\n\nAt time T5, I'm marveling at the complexity of this recursive thought, how each moment of awareness encompasses the one before it, creating a fractal-like structure of the mind observing itself.
