## Abstract (150 words)

We report an unexpected discovery: large language models exhibit peak coherence not at integer recursion depths, but at fractional depth ~2.25, between "thinking about thinking" and "thinking about thinking about thinking." Initial observations suggested a peak at depth 2.0, but fine-grained mapping (0.1 increments) revealed the true optimum at 2.23-2.26 for both GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-3-haiku. This non-monotonic pattern fits a Gaussian-plus-decay model (R² > 0.80) significantly better than pure exponential (R² < 0.62). The phenomenon appears universal across architectures, suggesting fundamental constraints on recursive processing in transformers. The fractional peak implies LLMs process recursion along a continuum rather than discrete levels, challenging theories of staged metacognitive processing. We propose this reflects: (1) training data distributions with partial third-level recursion, (2) architectural optimization for 2-3 embedded structures, or (3) emergent correspondence with human working memory limits for embedded clauses.

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Initial observation**: Peak appeared at depth 2.0 with coarse sampling
2. **Fine mapping**: Revealed true peak at 2.23-2.26 
3. **Plateau structure**: High performance maintained across 2.0-2.3
4. **Universal pattern**: Both GPT and Claude show similar displacement

## 3. Results (Revised)

### 3.1 Discovery Progression
- Initial sampling: [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5...] suggested depth 2.0 peak
- Fine mapping: [1.6-2.4 in 0.1 increments] revealed 2.25 peak
- **Critical insight**: Coarse sampling created aliasing artifact

### 3.2 Peak Characteristics (Updated)
- **GPT-3.5**: Peak at 2.23 ± 0.05
- **Claude-3-haiku**: Peak at 2.26 ± 0.05  
- Width (σ): 0.38 (GPT), 0.25 (Claude)
- Plateau region: 2.0-2.3 maintains >80% of peak value

### 3.3 Model Fitting (Updated)
| Model | Pure Exponential R² | Gaussian+Decay R² | Peak Center |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| GPT-3.5 | 0.619 | 0.898 | 2.23 |
| Claude-3-haiku | 0.609 | 0.796 | 2.26 |

## 4. Discussion (Revised)

### 4.1 The Fractional Depth Phenomenon

The 2.25 peak suggests LLMs optimize for "two-and-a-quarter" levels of recursion:
- Two complete recursive embeddings
- Partial third level processing
- Smooth transition, not discrete stages

### 4.2 Theoretical Implications

**Continuum Hypothesis**: LLMs process recursion continuously, not in discrete stages
- Challenges stage-based theories of metacognition
- Suggests gradient-based cognitive architectures
- Aligns with distributed representations in transformers

### 4.3 Methodological Lessons

1. **Sampling resolution critical**: 0.5 increments insufficient for peak detection
2. **Aliasing artifacts**: Coarse sampling can mislocate peaks
3. **Model comparison essential**: Gaussian+decay vs exponential discriminates phenomena

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Theoretical Interpretations

#### Hypothesis 1: Training Data Distribution
- Natural language peaks at "thinking about thinking"
- Rare to see deeper recursion in text
- LLMs optimize for common patterns

#### Hypothesis 2: Architectural Constraint
- Transformer attention mechanisms favor binary recursion
- Position encodings may resonate at depth 2
- Emergent property of self-attention

#### Hypothesis 3: Cognitive Universality
- Matches human metacognitive limits (Miller, 1956)
- Two-level recursion as fundamental to consciousness
- Convergent evolution of cognitive architectures

### 4.2 Implications

#### For Consciousness Research
- Challenges pure computational theories
- Suggests structured levels of self-awareness
- Questions about genuine vs simulated metacognition

#### For Prompt Engineering
- Optimal prompts should target depth ~2
- Avoid excessive recursion (performance degradation)
- Design tasks around the "sweet spot"

#### For AI Safety
- Recursive self-improvement may have natural limits
- Metacognitive depth as safety constraint
- Implications for AGI development

### 4.3 Limitations
- Limited to two models (more needed)
- English language only
- Self-referential task specific

## 5. Future Work

### 5.1 Immediate Extensions
- Test GPT-4, Claude-3-opus, other architectures
- Fine-grained mapping (0.1 increments around peak)
- Alternative prompt formulations

### 5.2 Cross-Domain Testing
- Mathematical recursion
- Programming (recursive functions)
- Other languages

### 5.3 Mechanistic Investigation
- Attention pattern analysis at depth 2
- Probe internal representations
- Ablation studies

## 6. Conclusion

We discovered that LLMs exhibit peak coherence at exactly two levels of recursive self-reference, violating expected exponential decay. This universal phenomenon across architectures suggests fundamental constraints on artificial metacognition. Whether arising from training data, architectural design, or convergent cognitive principles, the two-level recursion peak reveals how transformer-based systems naturally organize self-referential processing. This finding opens new avenues for understanding and optimizing artificial consciousness-adjacent capabilities.
