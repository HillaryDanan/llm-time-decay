## Abstract

We investigated temporal coherence patterns in large language models (GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-3-haiku) across recursive self-referential tasks at fractional depths (0.5-5.0). While initial results suggested a peak at depth 2.0, fine-grained mapping revealed high sensitivity to prompt formulation, with apparent peaks shifting between 2.0, 2.25, and 2.30 depending on measurement resolution and specific wording. Standard deviations reached 30% of mean values, indicating substantial response variability. Though we confirmed non-monotonic coherence patterns (rejecting pure exponential decay), the precise location and nature of optimal recursion depth proved unstable. These findings highlight critical methodological challenges in LLM evaluation: (1) extreme prompt sensitivity confounds behavioral measurements, (2) fine-grained sampling may reveal noise rather than signal, and (3) apparent architectural patterns may be measurement artifacts. We document these challenges as a contribution to rigorous LLM evaluation methodology.

## Key Findings

### Confirmed:
- Non-monotonic coherence patterns (not pure exponential decay)
- High variability in recursive task performance
- Both models show elevated performance in 2.0-2.3 range

### Unconfirmed:
- Specific "optimal" depth
- Precise peak location
- Architectural universality of patterns

### Discovered Challenges:
- Extreme prompt sensitivity
- Measurement instability at fine granularity
- Potential scoring system artifacts

## Methodological Lessons

### 1. Prompt Sensitivity Problem
- Single word changes ("substantially" vs "starting") can shift apparent peaks
- Peak location varied: 2.0 → 2.25 → 2.30 across experiments
- Suggests measuring prompt effects, not cognitive properties

### 2. Resolution Paradox
- Coarse sampling (0.5 increments): Clean patterns, possibly misleading
- Fine sampling (0.1 increments): Noisy patterns, multiple peaks
- Ultra-fine sampling (0.05 increments): Extreme variability, unstable results

### 3. Statistical Reality
- Standard deviations: 0.034-0.243 (up to 30% of means)
- Overlapping confidence intervals prevent precise peak identification
- N=30-50 per condition insufficient for stable estimates

## Scientific Interpretation

### What We Can Claim:
1. LLMs show non-monotonic response patterns to recursive prompts
2. Performance generally elevated in 2-3 recursion depth range
3. Response patterns are highly prompt-dependent

### What We Cannot Claim:
1. Specific optimal recursion depth
2. Universal architectural patterns
3. Fundamental cognitive constraints

## Future Directions

### More Robust Approaches:
1. **Multiple prompt formulations**: Test same depth with 10+ phrasings
2. **Task diversity**: Beyond self-referential recursion
3. **Direct mechanism probing**: Analyze attention patterns, not just outputs
4. **Statistical power**: N>100 per condition for stable estimates

### Alternative Research Questions:
1. Why are LLMs so prompt-sensitive at high recursion depths?
2. What makes 2-3 level recursion generally more stable?
3. How do different prompt features affect coherence?

## Contribution

This work contributes primarily as a **methodological cautionary tale**: apparent discoveries in LLM behavior may be measurement artifacts. We document how:

1. Initial "clean" findings dissolve under scrutiny
2. Increased measurement precision can reveal noise, not signal
3. Prompt engineering effects can masquerade as cognitive properties

These lessons are valuable for future LLM evaluation research, highlighting the need for:
- Robust prompt variation in experimental design
- Careful distinction between measurement artifacts and genuine phenomena
- Larger sample sizes than typically used

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Theoretical Interpretations

#### Hypothesis 1: Training Data Distribution
- Natural language peaks at "thinking about thinking"
- Rare to see deeper recursion in text
- LLMs optimize for common patterns

#### Hypothesis 2: Architectural Constraint
- Transformer attention mechanisms favor binary recursion
- Position encodings may resonate at depth 2
- Emergent property of self-attention

#### Hypothesis 3: Cognitive Universality
- Matches human metacognitive limits (Miller, 1956)
- Two-level recursion as fundamental to consciousness
- Convergent evolution of cognitive architectures

### 4.2 Implications

#### For Consciousness Research
- Challenges pure computational theories
- Suggests structured levels of self-awareness
- Questions about genuine vs simulated metacognition

#### For Prompt Engineering
- Optimal prompts should target depth ~2
- Avoid excessive recursion (performance degradation)
- Design tasks around the "sweet spot"

#### For AI Safety
- Recursive self-improvement may have natural limits
- Metacognitive depth as safety constraint
- Implications for AGI development

### 4.3 Limitations
- Limited to two models (more needed)
- English language only
- Self-referential task specific

## 5. Future Work

- Alternative prompt formulations

### 5.2 Cross-Domain Testing

- Ablation studies

## 6. Conclusion

We discovered that LLMs exhibit peak coherence at exactly two levels of recursive self-reference, violating expected exponential decay. This universal phenomenon across architectures suggests fundamental constraints on artificial metacognition. Whether arising from training data, architectural design, or convergent cognitive principles, the two-level recursion peak reveals how transformer-based systems naturally organize self-referential processing. This finding opens new avenues for understanding and optimizing artificial consciousness-adjacent capabilities.
